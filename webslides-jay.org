** *WebSlides is really easy* :slide:grid:verticalalign:wrap:column:halfquote:
Each parent =<section>= in the #webslides element is an individual slide.

Code looks neat, pure. It uses *intuitive markup* with popular naming
conventions. There's no need to overuse classes or nesting. Based
on [[https://github.com/jennschiffer/SimpleSlides][SimpleSlides]], by [[http://jennmoney.biz][Jenn Schiffer]]. *Tutorials*: [[../demos/components.html][Components]] · [[../demos/classes.html][Classes]].

- Use CSS styles to control appearance of slides
- Extra tags on a slide become extra CSS classes on its HTML


*** Notes                                                             :notes:

  - Which is a class defined in =projection.css=

* Placing Stylesheets/JavaScript                                      :slide:

Include the stylesheets and JavaScript at the *bottom* of your Org-Mode file.

They must go at the bottom because the Google Closure Library does not support an on-DOM-ready event. See the [[http://groups.google.com/group/closure-library-discuss/browse_thread/thread/1beecbb5d6afcb41/075c536259653946][Closure mailing list discussion]] for an explanation.

- Presenter notes for this slide
- Not displayed as part of the slide
- Displayed in Presenter Preview window
- Only one =notes= section per slide allowed

** Warning About Hidden Headlines                                     :slide:

Stylesheets and JavaScript will *not* be loaded if the *last* headline in your Org-Mode file is hidden by any of:

- =COMMENT= at the start of the heading
- =#+COMMENT= at the start of the line
- =:noexport:= tag, or missing =:export:= tag

See [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Comment-lines.html][Comment lines]] and [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Selective-export.html][Selective export]] in the Org-Mode manual for details.

** The End                                                            :slide:

Sometimes it's safest to add an "empty" heading at the end of your document to make sure the stylesheets and JavaScript are included.
