** show the Google movie
Goal / obstacle / solution

opportunity / obstacle / solution

** problem agitation solution


** Agitate

Poke at that problem until it's visceral


First you describe a problem, then you agitate by highlighting the emotions that go with the problem, and then you offer your solution.

** features vs. benefits

What's the feature

OK and? So what? How does that improve my life?

Present state vs. future state

ask so what as many times as you can.
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
To define a benefit you ask yourself So what?

- The oven preheats quickly
- So what?
- It’s quickly ready to start cooking your lasagna
- So what?
- Your food is on the table sooner
- So what?
- Life is less stressful
- There’s less hanging around the kitchen waiting for the oven to get ready. And you don’t have to worry you might forget to preheat your oven.

Microsoft and NLI collaborated on a thinking partnership to develop a customized feedback model, which they used to develop a training pilot.

NLI designed a Performance Management Executive Briefing and presented at CONNECT to senior business leaders. This early, top-down support enabled BevMo!'s to achieve real behavior change.

The team then designed interactive training tailored to employees at each of three levels: Corporate Vice Presidents, Partners, and High Potentials.

* change agility
Hi James,

We understand that change is a big topic of conversation for most organizations these days, as we are living in an environment where the status quo is no longer enough. Unfortunately, 70% of change initiatives fail to bring together employees to stand behind change and embed the 'new' into their everyday behaviors.

The problem is that most employees view their skills as innate and unchangeable. In this mode---known as a Fixed Mindset---the brain sees change as a threat. As a result, employees become anxious and defensive, get bogged down in details, and focus on problems instead of solutions.

The solution is to shift your organizational mindset. When employees adopt a Growth Mindset, they come to see change not as a threat but as a welcome challenge. Negative emotions become motivating, and they respond to failure by rising to the occasion, putting in more effort, and setting stretch goals. Equipped with a Growth Mindset, employees become more resilient, more creative, and better able to achieve goals and thrive in the face of uncertainty.

Join the NeuroLeadership Institute for a 45-minute webinar on ADAPT: The Neuroscience of Change Agility to provide employees and leaders with the habits needed to promote and sustain change.

We look forward to your participation.

Through the application and practice of these three habits, one habit at a time, managers increase the effectiveness of their performance conversations:

This includes the creation of individual action plans, utilization of decision guides for both individual and team situations, and the ability to apply these strategies to processes within the organization.

Through the adoption of three key habits, bias is mitigated at each of the three key phases of the hiring process: reviewing resumes, interviewing, and choosing.

You communicate really well
I like how you use humor in your presentation.

feedback.

You need to meet people where they are. A lot of people here come from prestigious academic backgrounds, but still there's a lot they can learn

First example.

Start with an actually pretty good email. Things that people might miss

You started off too basic

The thing on creating subject lines was good and useful.

Patricio created a cheat sheet for writing good subject lines

Every session should have a cheat sheet of tools that are actionable and remind people how to apply the skill they just learned.

You have good content, but it's like, how many habits can you build in one session? And you need to allow more time for practice

In each one of your sessions, think about: What are the 3 things that will have the most impact on our writing overall? Clarity? Structure? Story? Choose 3 habits or something like that

The subject line part is probably only relevant for salespeople?

Going forward, we need to design this training in a way is that it's applicable to anyone, whether they're salespeople or anything else.

So you need to choose which are the core modules.

Like for the subject line lesson, have a tricks and tips takeaway thing. Do that at the end each each session saying what the key takeaways are. Give people a cheat sheet / template and say keep this somewhere safe and then, when you're writing a headline, use this as a tricks and tips cheat sheet to make sure you're thinking through the thing some might otherwise feel like minute details.

Maybe during 2nd week you spend the first 20 minutes giving people a prompt and having them respond to it. Then you spend the whole time as a workshop, responding to what they wrote. That way you benchmark the audience first, as a pulse check see where they're at. People are more responsive to learning if they first see where they're at. As long as you have something positive and something negative to say about each person's email.

Teach fewer concepts overall.

The format of 4 weeks, 1 hour per week, is good. But teach fewer concepts. Something has to come out.

For the homework - there has to be social pressure to get the homework done. That public shaming. You need to have a way to get people to do the homework. There needs to be more pressure. Because people caught on that you weren't actually checking the homework.

Maybe you actually review the homework and provide written feedback? Not just to the one person you pick. Give them written feedback on the homework, actionable feedback on their own performance?

One way you could do the homework is if not written assignments, maybe you could build a form. Pick which one is the form... write a form and then go through the why - which people responded and then open a dialogue to why certain approaches are more meaningful than others

I loved your use of videos. I'm so glad you showed us that Google ad. Then you can watch an ad like that and ask yourself what did they do, wow yeah they just followed basic storytelling principles, churning your curiosity and emotions so that by the end you were super happy and sad.

The storytelling stuff might be applicable to all. I also liked what you taught about clarity, and actually answering people's questions. Making it clear, actually answering the questions addressing the points.

In each hour session, maybe you pick out the 3 basic things concepts and building practice around those, that people do either in the session or for homework.

Then maybe in one session, you make the first 20 minutes an in-depth review of the homework. Then 20 minutes on content and then the last 20 minutes are practice. so it's practice and discussion, practice and discussion.

Maybe it's you choose 2 strong concepts per session that you cover?

or maybe you do 2 true workshop sessions where it's more about the work, and then two where it's more about the learning. You mix up days where you don't plan on teaching anything new, just workshop based on what you just learned.

Then you have people getting in groups, they work on something together. So if there's 10 people, you have 3 groups of 3 working together trying to craft the best email, and then you see who's the best team crafting the best email. That way you have that positive status pressure of we want to craft the best email. Something like that would be tactically more fun, it gamifies it a bit and then the learning would stick longer. In each group you have one person saying "don't do that that's too cliché," so the group is kind of self-correcting in a way.

But I think you're really good, your communication is really good, your content is really good. I think you're a natural educator. I understand why you chose this as your profession. I think it's just a matter of implementing more practice time so it's not like a week later and like, what was that I learned?

So let's meet and crystallize what the objective will be for the 4 weeks. Decide: what do we want to be meaningfully improved? What skills will be top of mind talking to anybody? So we crystallize what those 1-2 objectives are.

then we can do a test to see if we hit that mark. Like test retest? In the first session people write an email in the first 20 minutes. And then in the last 20 minutes of the 4th week they write another email. Maybe even using the same prompt. And then you see, what would you do differently. They won't know they'll see the same prompt twice. but that way you make the distinctions in performance operationalizable.

Remember 2-3 concepts. Patricio: the clarity, making everything short. I wait, then I go back and take 5-7 words out.

And then reminders, build reminders, build the sheet

The header is always those tips.


darlings.doc


Create a template for codes for things you should do every time you write an email

Concise. integration for that.

Every time you open your email, it asks you 3 questions.


On a google doc.


In your proposal, just talk about how we'll leverage our own research. Explain how you're building in AGES and how it applies. Say things like "this design will be more likely to allow people to reach their own insights..." etc

And build in more practice!
