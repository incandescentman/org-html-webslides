*** Notes                :notes:noexport:

** PRINCIPLE Writing with the reader in mind

** Curiosity
[[/Users/jay/Dropbox/github/org-html-webslides/assets/img/videogame-brain-desire.png]]


** The Curiosity Gap
- need for closure
- we don't like gaps in our knowledge

** The Curiosity Gap
- The curiosity gap is the space between a piece of information (*what we know*) and the missing information (*what we don't know*).


*** Notes                                :notes:noexport:
Humans have a natural desire for closureâ€“ we don't like having gaps in our knowledge. You can leverage this desire for closure by leaving your subject line open-ended so subscribers will be curious, like a cliffhanger that can only be satisfied by opening the email. You can make subscribers curious by asking a question (and answering it in your email), promising something interesting (like pictures or a surprise gift), or saying something that sounds strange or unusual.
